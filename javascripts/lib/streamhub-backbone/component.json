This is the core library, and there are other libraries for pluggable Views.\n\nStreamHub-Backbone was used to power Livefyre's [CES 2013 NewsHub](http://ces.livefyre.com/)\n\n![CES 2013 NewsHub Screenshot](http://d.pr/i/71lK+)\n\n[Livefyre StreamHub](http://www.livefyre.com/streamhub/) is the web's first Engagement Management System. StreamHub turns your site into a real-time social experience. Curate images, videos, and Tweets from across the social web, right into live blogs, chats, widgets, and dashboards. The world's biggest publishers and brands use StreamHub to power their online Content Communities.\n\nStreamHub-Backbone displays Collections of Content in StreamHub Networks. To get your own Network so you can create your own Collections, engage your own community of SSO Users, and curate Content that appeals to your users, [contact Livefyre](http://www.livefyre.com/streamhub/) about subscribing to StreamHub.\n\n[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) is an MVC framework for building JavaScript applications that was sent from the heavens to make JavaScript fun again. Big thanks to @documentcloud.\n\n# Using it\n\n[Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) is used for dependency management. You can install the dependencies with\n\n    bower install\n\nIf you are unable to use bower, you can download the components dir as a tar\n\n    curl -L \"http://d.pr/f/DC3b+\" > components.tar.gz\n    tar -xvf components.tar.gz\n\nStreamHub-Backbone is written as a series of [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) modules. You will need to use an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) to use it. Add it as a package in your RequireJS config:\n\n    packages: [{\n        name: 'streamhub-backbone',\n        location: './path/to/streamhub-backbone'\n    }]\n\nThen you can use it like:\n\n    require(['streamhub-backbone'], function (Hub) {\n        // Hub some Streams, yo\n    })\n\nIf you refuse to use your own AMD loader, `streamhub-backbone.almond.js` has a pre-loaded AMD loader as `require`. You probably want to use that unless your project uses RequireJS. (TODO: Namespace this require)\n\nThis is a new project. It will have bugs and is released under an MIT License. Please feel free to leave a GitHub issue to report a bug, submit a Pull Request, or just say Hi.\n\nIf you are using this in production for important things, you should fork the repo.\n\n`main.css` contains some good default styles for the default views.\n\n# Example\n\nMost interesting things involve using the StreamHub JavaScript SDK, which you can find [here](http://zor.fyre.co/wjs/v3.0/javascripts/livefyre.js)\n\nLoad an sdk for a given StreamHub Network, then create a Hub\n\n    require(['streamhub-backbone'], function (Hub) {\n        fyre.conv.load({\n            network: 'labs.fyre.co'\n        }, [{\n            app: 'sdk'\n        }], _loadApp);\n        function _loadApp (sdk) {\n            var app = new Hub({\n                el: document.getElementById(\"example-id\"),\n                sdk: sdk,\n                collection: {\n                    siteId: '320568',\n                    articleId: \"brands_canonical\"\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    });\n\nYou can also see some demos in `index.html`, `index-built.html` (with almond build), and `test/examples/*`.\n\n# Hub Constructor\n\nThe module can be used with `new` to construct a Hub for Streams to play in. It accepts these parameters:\n\n* `sdk` - An instance of the Livefyre StreamHub JS SDK, loaded from `fyre.conv.load`\n* `collection` - An object with the siteid and articleId of the Collection you want to display. There will someday be support for many Collections bound to one Hub, or other sets of Content like results from the Most Liked API\n* `el` - The HTML Element to display in\n* `view` - (FeedView) - A Backbone View that should handle the visuals. Hub will create a Collection model and start it up, then proxy to your View for arbitrary forms of hubbing and streaming\n\n# Documentation\n\nStreamHub-Backbone uses [jsdoc3](http://usejsdoc.org/) to generate HTML documentation from the source code.\n\nYou can [read the docs here](http://gobengo.github.com/streamhub-backbone/docs/).\n\n## Building the Documentation\n\nThe code is documented using [jsdoc3](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc). From the project root:\n\nInstall jsdoc3\n\n    npm install git://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc.git\n    \nGenerate this project's docs into the 'docs' directory\n\n    node_modules/jsdoc/jsdoc -c tools/jsdoc.conf.js models/* views/* main.js const/* README.md templates/* -d docs\n\n# Tests\n\nThere are a decent number of tests written for StreamHub-Backbone's core models and views. There is a jasmine runner you can use in `test/index.html` and BDD specs in `test/spec`.\n\nYou can always [run the tests online](http://gobengo.github.com/streamhub-backbone/test/).\n\n# Building\n\nGenerate almond build:\n\n    node tools/r.js -o tools/build.js\n\n",
